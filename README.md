### Memory Leak Detection in React with MemLab

## Overview

This repository demonstrates how to detect and fix memory leaks in a React application using MemLab. The example provided focuses on common memory leak scenarios, such as:

- Unremoved event listeners

- Uncleared intervals/timers

- Stale references causing unintended memory retention

By following this guide, you will learn how to effectively identify and resolve memory leaks in React applications to improve performance and prevent unnecessary memory consumption.

### Features

- A Timer Component that initially introduces memory leaks.

- An updated version of the Timer Component with fixes to prevent memory leaks.

- A MemLab Scenario File to automate memory leak detection.
